# WebChat - A very simple webchat bukkit plugin
---
WebChat is a simple, unfinished bukkit plugin that opens a web server with an interface to the server chat.  Users can watch server chat live as well as send messages, which will appear as source "WEB".

NOTE:  This plugin is unfinished and is really just a proof of concept.  The entire web part needs to be rewritten to use Javascript, because the HTML version flashes and can't properly scroll.  Configuration files are also not yet implemented, and many security features (spam protection, show source as IP, logging, etc) have not been finished.  That being said, it *does* work and can be used a base for a better chat system.
